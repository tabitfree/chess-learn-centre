                    <p>1. e4 is one of the most popular and aggressive chess openings.

There are many variations of the e4 opening, such as the Sicilian Defense, the French Defense, and the Caro-Kann Defense, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. e4 is often played by aggressive and attacking players, as it can lead to complex and dynamic games.</p>
